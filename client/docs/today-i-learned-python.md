## Mutable default arguments

__NOTE__: Information taken from [python guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/gotchas/)

One of the most confusing moments for new developers is when they discover how Python treats default arguments in function definitions.

Let's say you want to define a function that accepts a list as a parameter, and you want the default value of that list to be the empty list, so you write:

```python
def append_to(element, to=[]):
    to.append(element)
    return to
```

If everything was okay, you would expect the following behavior:

```python
my_list = append_to(12)
print my_list

my_other_list = append_to(42)
print my_other_list
```

```
[12]
[42]
```

But what you get instead is:

```
[12]
[12, 42]
```

A new list is created once when the function is defined, and the same list is used in each successive call.

Pythonâ€™s default arguments are evaluated once when the function is defined, instead of each time the function is called (like it is in say Ruby). This means that if you use a mutable default argument and mutate it, you will and have mutated that object for all future calls to the function as well.

### What you should do

Create a new object each time the function is called, by using a default arg to signal that no argument was provided (`None` is often a good choice):

```python
def append_to(element, to=None):
    if to is None:
        to = []
    to.append(element)
    return to
```

## Setuptools entry points

When building a Python package, the most common way of exposing a command line interface (CLI) is to use the "scripts" keyword in `setup.py`.

```python
# file: setup.py
from setuptools import setup

setup(
  name='my_package',
  scripts=['scripts/my_cli'],
  ...
)
```

However, **entry points** represents an improved and cross-platform approach to accomplish the same goal.

```python
# file: setup.py
from setuptools import setup

setup(
  name='my_package',
  entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
      'my_cli': 'my_package.cli:main'
    ]
  },
  ...
)
```

What's happens when the user installs the package is that ``pip`` will make sure that ``my_cli`` is available as an executable on the system. Once invoked, the ``main`` function of the ``my_package.cli`` module
will be called.

```bash
pip install my_package
my_cli  # the main function is called
Usage: my_cli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
```

The problem with the former approach is that it requires separating CLI related code into a isolated file outside the main package. With **entry points** it's possible to unify all source code under the same package directory. This makes testing significantly easier.

There's actually a lot more you can use entry points for. It is ideally suited to act as a simple way for third party plugins to hook into your application. A great example of such integration is employed by `pytest` for their excellent plugin architecture.

You can also find out more in the `setuptools` docs.
